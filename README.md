# resume
### Repo Description
Maintaining my resume, now written in LaTeX

### Detailed description
I wanted to write my resume in LaTeX this time around so it is more maintainable (and not limited to what Word wants it to look like).

I have a pretty decent background in using LaTaX have written not only my masters degree thesis using it, but a great number of my homework assignments and tests for our students during that time.

Being such a flexible markup language I decided it would be a perfect way to have a maintainable and version controlled resume format. With that decision in mind I found a couple of examples using the altacv template as a jumping off point, including [the semi-famous Marissa Meyer one](https://github.com/liantze/AltaCV).

After several modifications and enhancements I now have a new, easier to maintain resume similar to what I have previously had before with [EnhanCV](enhancv.com) (if you've never used the service it is worth checking out).

In the end I have come up with a resume that I am quite please with and now have total access to change any element I want in any way like I am used to as a LatTeX user, version controlling that I am used to from day-to-day work, and it's always available to me no metter where I am at as it is up here on Github.

If you have any questions please feel free to reach out.
